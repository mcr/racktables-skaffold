This skeleton is for testing racktables.

Run 
	0) set public-> your racktables code
	1) etc/fixup.sh
	2) etc/initdb.sh
	3) etc/rundb.sh
	4) etc/runweb.sh	
	5) touch public/inc/secret.php 

Then visit http://localhost:xxxx/install.php  where xxxx is 7000 + uid.
(It will be printed by etc/runweb.sh)

When it asks for the database host, enter something like:
       /home/mcr/C/nv/ispv6/racktables-test/run/mysqld.sock

rather than a hostname.  I wish that PDO would pay attention to the mysql
socket set in the php.ini, but it does not.  To make this work, you need the
patch at:
       http://github.com/mcr/racktables/commit/4de52bb45cef35742c77c0b9085e44342c43656f 
(and you probably want the whitespace patch after that one)

The database password for the racktables database is:
	eiG7Oo1x	

The default admin password is:
	kaG2aeh5

The root database password is:
        Ahw3ooh2

This skeleton also sets phpmyadmin (if you apt-get install phpmyadmin),
just visit:
	http://localhost:xxxx/phpmyadmin/index.php
        login with root and pw Ahw3ooh2
